            <p align="justify"> From the daily chores in our life to the nonroutine behavior we undertake, things has been digitized. Like for example the daily chores starts with the 'To-do list' where we jot down the activities we need to perform in a day or be it the 'Time-table' of a student with specific period of time assigned for each subject. It can also be the 'Shopping List' for a homemaker to make a note of all the groceries to be bought for a month or a 'Collection of favorite quotes and proverbs' of an individual as his/her hobby or even helping a 'writer with the possible word usages' in times where he/she gets stuck with the help of a search engine. Noting down such stuff is no longer a paper pen matter as it has all been stored in digital texts. These days we humans actually do not remember the spelling of even the simplest words because of the prediction system behind the devices we use. Be it the movie name or the song we like to listen, by just typing certain keywords we are able get what we were exactly looking out for. Just as how one of the ancient means of communication - Telegram just vanished away, in near future we would see people relying only on their mobile phones for almost everything. This is because people have even stopped watching TV and stopped reading the newspapers offline. As TV programs do not get played according to the users wish, now even advanced technology of backing up the data of shows they missed have come up. Newspapers has also become digitized and turned into applications that could be read as and when possible.</p>

            <p align="justify">Apart from all these datum that is created from simple chores the world has moved into another phase of generating digital datum. This is nothing but the usage of Social media as part of ones life. These days people do not really bother of whether they ate or slept but instead do social networking. This has turned out to be a significant part in every humans life. There are people who not just chat or post important events, but also keep updating their daily life movements in public on Social medias.</p>

            <p align="justify">From the above scenarios, we can make out that everything is at a one click away afar, within our five fingers. If one has closely noted about the amount of data generated from all these activities of the humans, the amount of text data generated would rank the first position amongst all the other datum(voice, video, image, etc.). So what is a text data and how is this useful? </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote" align="justify">"Data is the new oil. It's valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a  valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value." - Clive Humby </blockquote>

            <p align="justify">Text data could be anything from the message we send a friend, to the content we write for a journal. It comes under structred, semi-structured and unstructured category. Structured involves pre-defined formats for application forms, loan forms, birth certificates, and etc., while semi-structured includes the journals, conference proceedings and etc. The rest of the mass data that an individual generates like the chats, posts, comments, reviews, articles, blogs, descriptions and etc. comes under the unstructured category. In real life, the unstructured data grows faster than the former two categories. This has eventually led to the building of various applications that handles real time data and also benefits the human in return.</p>

	    <p align="justify"> One such application is Sentiment Analysis. In plain, Sentiment analysis is an idea of examining the natural text data generated by a human and to bring out the emotions behind it. Emotions can be broadly classified into Happy, Sad and Neutral. Determining if a text data falls into one of the three categories is the prime target behind this application. Sentiment analysis focuses on improving the business stratergy by reviewing the customer satisfaction from the comments they post for the product they purchase, in recommender systems for analysis of fequently bought items to recommend similar products to the customer, add placement based on the interest on the product frequently brought, regualtory compliance for product liability based on customer reviews and other features, conversational models or chat bots to respond and query based on the end user's mood and etc. Similar to these usages one such possibility in using Sentiment analysis in NEWS data would be to come up with an application that delivers only positive NEWS to the end user which we have named it as GoodEarth.</p>

	    <p align="justify" >In today's scenario, imagining a world without negativity is something very unrealistic, as bad NEWS spreads more virally than good ones.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            

            

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
